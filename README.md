This is http://podcast.retina.net where we store edited podcasts.

There are some tools in here for tagging, updating, and posting podcasts as well as tools/renderpage.py that will render out the RSS feed and HTML feed based on the contents of showindex.json

Primarily, this is for my own use, but it's nice to have a backup on github.

You may also be interested in tools/add_image.py which adds images to mp3 files, or tools/apply_basic_tags.py which handles some basic tagging for iTunes.
